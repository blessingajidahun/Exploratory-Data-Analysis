# Consumer Behaviour Analysis
## Problem:
Online retailers need to understand customer purchasing patterns and delivery preferences to optimize product recommendations, inventory planning, and delivery logistics. Without clear insight into how customers behave, decisions are based on guesswork rather than data.

## Objective:
Analyze the e-commerce consumer dataset to identify high-value customer segments, popular products, delivery preferences, and actionable trends that support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Used

## Approach

### Data Cleaning:
Imported the ecommerce_consumer_behavior_analysis_data.xlsx dataset from Kaggle.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing categorical fields to ensure accuracy and consistency.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted pivot table analysis in Excel to understand transaction volumes, customer order patterns, and delivery method preferences.
Identified key trends across product categories and geographic regions.
### Visualization & Insights:
Built interactive dashboards using Excel PivotCharts to represent key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
Most frequently purchased products
Peak purchase times
Preferred delivery types
Correlations between product type and delivery choice

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: Pivot Tables, PivotCharts, data cleaning, trend analysis

- E-commerce Consumer Dataset (kaggle): Source data for analysis

## 📈 Key Results & Business Impact
- Identified the top 5 product categories that generate the highest purchase frequency, enabling targeted inventory replenishment and marketing focus.
