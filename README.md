## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/blessingajidahun/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/ecommerce_consumer_behavior_analysis_data.csv">Dataset</a>
## Processes
After downloading the dataset, the first thing I did was to go through it, familiarize myself with what each column meant, then I checked for duplicate values, there was none, I also checked for blank cells, there was none. This means the dataset is clean and I can go on with my analysis. I used pivot table majorly for his analysis and certain functions like CORREL and IF statements.
