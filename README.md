# Consumer Behaviour Analysis
## Problem:
Online retailers need to understand customer purchasing patterns and delivery preferences to optimize product recommendations, inventory planning, and delivery logistics. Without clear insight into how customers behave, decisions are based on guesswork rather than data.

## Objective:
Analyze the e-commerce consumer dataset to identify high-value customer segments, popular products, delivery preferences, and actionable trends that support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/blessingajidahun/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/ecommerce_consumer_behavior_analysis_data.csv">Dataset</a>
## Approach

### Data Cleaning:
Imported the ecommerce_consumer_behavior_analysis_data.xlsx dataset from Kaggle.
Cleaned the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing categorical fields to ensure accuracy and consistency.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted pivot table analysis in Excel to understand transaction volumes, customer order patterns, and delivery method preferences.
Identified key trends across product categories and geographic regions.
### Visualization & Insights:
Built interactive dashboards using Excel PivotCharts to represent key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
Most frequently purchased products
Peak purchase times
Preferred delivery types
Correlations between product type and delivery choice

🧰 ## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Pivot Tables, PivotCharts, data cleaning, trend analysis
E-commerce Consumer Dataset (kaggle): Source data for analysis

📈### Key Results & Business Impact
Identified the top 5 product categories that generate the highest purchase frequency, enabling targeted inventory replenishment and marketing focus.
Discovered that delivery preferences vary significantly by region, suggesting a need for region-specific logistics strategies to improve delivery satisfaction.
Created interactive dashboards that highlight actionable trends, supporting decision-makers with clear, visual insights instead of raw spreadsheets.
Delivered insights that can improve customer experience and help operations plan more efficiently based on real consumer behavior.
#### RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Since social media-influenced customers spend more, we  increase efforts in targeted ads, influencer collaborations, and content marketing to engage customers.
- We can turn the “none social media influenced category into engage followers by running social media campaigns and offer exclusive discounts to encourage engagement.
- Since highly influenced customers are already reviewing, we should amplify this with campaigns like:"Share your review and get a discount!", "Post your purchase and tag us to win rewards!"
### TASK 6: Return rate and product quality: do product with low rating have higher return rates, which product category has the highest return rate, are dissatisfied customers more likely to return products
I used pivot table to carry out this analysis.
### Key Insights Discovered:
- Higher-Rated Products (4 & 5) Have the Most Returns:
  - Rating 5 has the highest total returns (211), followed by rating 4 (210).
  - Despite being high-rated, these products see substantial returns, likely due to unmet high expectations or buyer’s remorse.
- Lower-Rated Products (1 & 2) Have a Moderate Return Rate:
  - Rating 1 (205 total returns) and Rating 2 (189) suggest that low-quality products also face returns, but not as much as high-rated ones.
  - This could indicate that customers expect issues with low-rated products and may hesitate to return them.
- Return Rate Increases with Product Rating (1 → 5):
  - Lower-rated products (1, 2, 3) have fewer returns in category 2 (frequent returners).
  - Higher-rated products (4 & 5) have the most category 2 returns (72 & 63), meaning customers return them multiple times.
- Higher Overall Returns for High-Rated Products (4 & 5):
  - Rating 5 has the highest total returns (211), followed by rating 4 (210).
  - Despite high quality, these products are still returned often—possibly due to high expectations.
- These discoveries made me do a further research and analysis on the purchase intent, to know possible reasons why high rated products are returned. The following insights were what discovered:
- Impulsive and Wants-Based Purchases Drive Returns for Low-Rated Products:
  - Product Rating 1 has the highest wants-based return rate (59).
  - Impulsive returns are also highest for rating 4 (65), suggesting some customers regret impulsive high-quality purchases.
  - Need-Based Purchases Have the Highest Returns for Mid-Rated Products:
  - Product Rating 2 has the highest need-based returns (63), implying that essential products with mid-level quality don’t fully satisfy users.
- Planned Purchases Have the Lowest Return Volatility:
  - Return rates for planned purchases remain stable across all ratings (43-59).
  - This suggests planned buyers make more informed and satisfactory decisions.
- The Top 3 returned product categories are:
  - Electronics with 54 counts of return rate, Sports & Outdoor – 51 counts of return rate and finally Jewelry & Accessories and Home Appliances categories have 50 counts pf return rate each.
- Dissastisfied customers are more likely to return products. The analysis showed that Not Satisfied customers have a counts of 610 return rate, while Satisfied customers have a count of 390 return rate.
#### Recommendations
  - Enhance product durability, usability, or packaging to reduce dissatisfaction-driven returns
  - Offer extended warranties or trials to build customer confidence
  - Since these essential products have high returns, focus on better materials, packaging, and durability.
  - To discourage impulse returns, implement a restocking fee or provide returns as store credit instead of cash refunds
